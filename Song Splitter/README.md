# Song Splitter
Place a downloaded album in a folder named "Input" and set the timestamps in Timestamps.txt. Then, run Run.bat or Splitter.py to split
the album into its seperate songs. The script will also set the metadata of each song.

Timestamps.txt is formatted like this:

```
ALBUM NAME
ARTIST NAME
TIMESTAMP,SONG NAME
TIMESTAMP,SONG NAME
TIMESTAMP,SONG NAME
TIMESTAMP,SONG NAME
...
```

Timestamps can either be MM:SS or HH:MM:SS
